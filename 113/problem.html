<h2>Non-bouncy numbers</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 113</h3><span>Published on Friday, 10th February 2006, 06:00 pm; Solved by 6314</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">

<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p>
<p>Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.</p>
<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a &quot;bouncy&quot; number; for example, 155349.</p>
<p>As <i>n</i> increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below <i>n</i> increases such that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p>How many numbers below a googol (10<sup>100</sup>) are not bouncy?</p>
