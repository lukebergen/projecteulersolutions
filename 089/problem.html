<h2>Roman numerals</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 89</h3><span>Published on Friday, 18th February 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 11926</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each number (see <a href="about=roman_numerals">About Roman Numerals...</a>). However, there is always a &quot;best&quot; way of writing a particular number.</p>
<p>For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px;font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br />
VIIIIIIIIIII<br />
VVIIIIII<br />
XIIIIII<br />
VVVI<br />
XVI</p>
<p>The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.</p>
<p>The 11K text file, <a href="project/resources/p089_roman.txt">roman.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units and obey the subtractive pair rule (see <a href="about=roman_numerals">About Roman Numerals...</a> for the definitive rules for this problem).</p>
<p>Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.</p>
<p class="note">Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.</p>
