<h2>Digit factorial chains</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 74</h3><span>Published on Friday, 16th July 2004, 06:00 pm; Solved by 14292</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">

<p>The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:</p>
<p style='margin-left:50px;'>1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:</p>
<p style='margin-left:50px;'>169 &rarr; 363601 &rarr; 1454 &rarr; 169<br />
871 &rarr; 45361 &rarr; 871<br />
872 &rarr; 45362 &rarr; 872</p>
<p>It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,</p>
<p style='margin-left:50px;'>69 &rarr; 363600 &rarr; 1454 &rarr; 169 &rarr; 363601 (&rarr; 1454)<br />
78 &rarr; 45360 &rarr; 871 &rarr; 45361 (&rarr; 871)<br />
540 &rarr; 145 (&rarr; 145)</p>
<p>Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>
<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>
