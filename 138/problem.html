<h2>Special isosceles triangles</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 138</h3><span>Published on Saturday, 20th January 2007, 11:00 am; Solved by 3222</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, <i>b</i> = 16, and legs, L = 17.</p>
<div style='text-align:center;'>
<img src='project/images/p138.gif' width='230' height='228' alt='' />
</div>
<p>By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, <i>h</i> = &radic;(17<sup>2</sup> &minus; 8<sup>2</sup>) = 15, which is one less than the base length.</p>
<p>With <i>b</i> = 272 and L = 305, we get <i>h</i> = 273, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that <i>h</i> = <i>b</i> &plusmn; 1.</p>
<p>Find &sum; L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which <i>h</i> = <i>b</i> &plusmn; 1 and <i>b</i>, L are positive integers.</p>
