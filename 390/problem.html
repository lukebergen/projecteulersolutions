<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<P>Consider the triangle with sides &radic;5, &radic;65 and &radic;68.
It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.</P>

<P>S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides &radic;(1+b<sup>2</sup>), &radic;(1+c<sup>2</sup>) and &radic;(b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.</P>

<P>The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.</P>

<P>S(10<sup>6</sup>)=18018206.</P>

<P>Find S(10<sup>10</sup>).</P>
