<h2>Stone Game III</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 366</h3><span>Published on Saturday, 7th January 2012, 07:00 pm; Solved by 355</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<P>
Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.<BR />
There is one pile of n stones.<BR />
The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the whole pile.<BR />
Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his opponent took on the previous move.<BR />
The player who removes the last stone wins.
</P>
<P>
E.g. n=5<BR />
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be able to take all remaining stones.<BR />
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take also one stone, leaving three stones.<BR />
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2 stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.<BR />
So 5 is a losing position for the first player.<BR />
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.<BR />
E.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.
</P>
<P>
Let M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position <i>at his first turn</i> and M(n)=0 for any other position.
</P>
<P>
&sum;M(n) for n&le;100 is 728.
</P>
<P>
Find  &sum;M(n) for n&le;10<sup>18</sup>.
Give your answer modulo 10<sup>8</sup>.
