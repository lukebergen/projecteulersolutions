<h2>Truncatable primes</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 37</h3><span>Published on Friday, 14th February 2003, 06:00 pm; Solved by 38605</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">

<p>The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.</p>
<p>Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.</p>
<p class='info'>NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.</p>
