<h2>Rudin-Shapiro sequence</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 384</h3><span>Published on Sunday, 13th May 2012, 02:00 am; Solved by 256</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<P>Define the sequence a(n) as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in the binary expansion of n (possibly overlapping).
<BR/>E.g.: a(5) = a(101<sub>2</sub>) = 0, a(6) = a(110<sub>2</sub>) = 1, a(7) = a(111<sub>2</sub>) = 2</P>

<P>Define the sequence b(n) = (-1)<sup>a(n)</sup>.
<BR/>This sequence is called the <B>Rudin-Shapiro</B> sequence.</P>
<P>Also consider the summatory sequence of b(n): <img src=project/images/p384_formula.gif style="margin-top:-9px;">.</P>

<P>The first couple of values of these sequences are:
<BR/><TT>n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 2 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 4 &nbsp &nbsp; 5 &nbsp &nbsp; 6 &nbsp &nbsp; 7
<BR/>a(n) &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 0 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 2
<BR/>b(n) &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp;-1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp;-1 &nbsp &nbsp; 1
<BR/>s(n) &nbsp &nbsp; 1 &nbsp &nbsp; 2 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 2 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 4 &nbsp &nbsp; 3 &nbsp &nbsp; 4</TT></P>

<P>The sequence s(n) has the remarkable property that all elements are positive and every positive integer k occurs exactly k times.</P>

<P>Define g(t,c), with 1 &le; c &le; t, as the index in s(n) for which t occurs for the c'th time in s(n).
<BR/>E.g.: g(3,3) = 6, g(4,2) = 7 and g(54321,12345) = 1220847710.</P>

<P>Let F(n) be the fibonacci sequence defined by:
<BR/>F(0)=F(1)=1 and
<BR/>F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>1.</P>

<P>Define GF(t)=g(F(t),F(t-1)).</P>

<P>Find &Sigma;GF(t) for 2&le;t&le;45.</P>
