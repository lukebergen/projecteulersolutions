<h2>Anagramic squares</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 98</h3><span>Published on Friday, 17th June 2005, 06:00 pm; Solved by 5679</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36<sup>2</sup>. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 96<sup>2</sup>. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.</p>
<p>Using <a href="project/resources/p098_words.txt">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).</p>
<p>What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?</p>
<p class='info'>NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.</p>
