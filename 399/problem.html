<P>
The first 15 fibonacci numbers are:<BR />
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.<BR />
It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4 and 144 is divisible by 4 and by 9.<BR /> 
So the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:<BR />
1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377 and 610.

The 200th squarefree fibonacci number is:
971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445.<BR />
The last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in scientific notation this number can be written as 9.7e53.
</P>
<P>
Find the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number.<BR />
Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the decimal point).<BR />
For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been: 1608739584170445,9.7e53

Note:<BR /> 
For this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci number divisible by p is not divisible by p<sup>2</sup> (this is part of <b>Wall's conjecture</b>). This has been verified for primes &le; 3Â·10<sup>15</sup>, but has not been proven in general.<BR />

If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to this problem isn't guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for that number.
