<h2>Crack-free Walls</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 215</h3><span>Published on Friday, 31st October 2008, 01:00 pm; Solved by 2251</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2&times;1 and 3&times;1 bricks (horizontal&times;vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a &quot;running crack&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, the following 9&times;3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="project/images/p/p215_crackfree.gif" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9&times;3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.</p>

<p>Calculate W(32,10).</p>
