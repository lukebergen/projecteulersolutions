<div class="problem_content" role="problem">

<p>By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, &minus;, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p style='margin-left:50px;font-family:courier new;'>8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2<br />
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)<br />
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) &minus; 1<br />
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)</p>
<p>Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.</p>
<p>Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.</p>
<p>Find the set of four distinct digits, <i>a</i> &lt; <i>b</i> &lt <i>c</i> &lt; <i>d</i>, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to <i>n</i>, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: <i>abcd</i>.</p>
