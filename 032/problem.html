<h2>Pandigital products</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 32</h3><span>Published on Friday, 6th December 2002, 06:00 pm; Solved by 36436</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>We shall say that an <var>n</var>-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to <var>n</var> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.</p>

<p>The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 &times; 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>

<p>Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.</p>

<div class="note">HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.</div>
