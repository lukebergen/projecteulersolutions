<h2>Cutting Rectangular Grid Paper</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 338</h3><span>Published on Sunday, 15th May 2011, 01:00 am; Solved by 209</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions <var>w</var> &times; <var>h</var> is given. Its grid spacing is 1.<br />
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.</p>
<p>For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 &times; 4 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 &times; 2, 12 &times; 3 and 6 &times; 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:</p>

</div>

<p>Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 &times; 8 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 &times; 4 and 12 &times; 6 .</p>

<p>For a pair <var>w</var> and <var>h</var>, let F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>) be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions <var>w</var> &times; <var>h</var> .<br />
For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2. <br />
Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>).<br />
Note also that rectangles with dimensions <var>w</var> &times; <var>h</var> and dimensions <var>h</var> &times; <var>w</var> are not considered distinct.</p>

<p>For an integer <var>N</var>, let G(<var>N</var>) be the sum of F(<var>w</var>,<var>h</var>) for all pairs <var>w</var> and <var>h</var> which satisfy 0 &lt; <var>h</var> &le; <var>w</var> &le; <var>N</var>.<br />
We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(10<sup>3</sup>) = 971745 and G(10<sup>5</sup>) = 9992617687.</p>

<p>Find G(10<sup>12</sup>). Give your answer modulo 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>
