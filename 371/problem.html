Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit number (each digit can be from [0..9]).<BR />
While driving to work Seth plays the following game:<BR />
Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000 that's a win.
</p>
<p>
E.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long as he sees them in the same trip). 
<p>
<p>
Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.<BR />
Give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.
</p>
<p style="font-size:88%">
<b>Note:</b> We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three digit number on it.
