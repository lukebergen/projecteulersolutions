<h2>Guessing Game</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 406</h3><span>Published on Sunday, 16th December 2012, 07:00 am; Solved by 187</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br />
<ul>
<li> "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of <var>a</var>), or</li>
<li> "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of <var>b</var>), or</li>
<li> "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p>

<p>For example, if <var>n</var> = 5, <var>a</var> = 2, and <var>b</var> = 3, then we may begin by asking "<b>2</b>" as our first question.</p>

<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that "<b>1</b>" is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style='color:blue;'><b>3</b></span>).<br />
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be "<b>4</b>".<br />
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that "<b>3</b>" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style='color:blue;'><b>5</b></span>).<br />
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that "<b>5</b>" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style='color:blue;'><b>4</b></span>).<br />
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style='color:red;'><b>5</b></span>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. 
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>

<p>Let C(<var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:<br />
C(5, 2, 3) = 5<br />
C(500, &radic;2, &radic;3) = 13.22073197...<br />
C(20000, 5, 7) = 82<br />
C(2000000, &radic;5, &radic;7) = 49.63755955...</p>

<p>Let F<sub><var>k</var></sub> be the Fibonacci numbers: F<sub><var>k</var></sub> = F<sub><var>k</var>-1</sub> + F<sub><var>k</var>-2</sub> with base cases F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub> = 1.<br />Find &sum;<sub>1&le;<var>k</var>&le;30</sub>&nbsp;C(10<sup>12</sup>, &radic;<var>k</var>, &radic;F<sub><var>k</var></sub>), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>
