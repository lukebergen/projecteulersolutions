<h2>Cutting Squares</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 270</h3><span>Published on Saturday, 26th December 2009, 01:00 am; Solved by 452</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N&times;N is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the <var>x</var>- and <var>y</var>-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:
<ul>
<li>We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.</li>
<li>Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.</li>
<li>Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N&times;N square. For example, C(1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;2 and C(2)&thinsp;=&thinsp;30 (shown below).</p>
