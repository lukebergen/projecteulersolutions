<h2>Using up to one million tiles how many different "hollow" square laminae can be formed?</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 173</h3><span>Published on Saturday, 22nd December 2007, 01:00 pm; Solved by 5356</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square &quot;hole&quot; so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="project/images/p173_square_laminas.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<p>With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.</p>
