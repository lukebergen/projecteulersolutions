<h2>Lattice Quadrilaterals</h2><div id="problem_info" class="info"><h3>Problem 453</h3><span>Published on Saturday, 4th January 2014, 04:00 pm; Solved by 94</span></div>
<div class="problem_content" role="problem">
<p>A <b>simple quadrilateral</b> is a polygon that has four distinct vertices, has no straight angles and does not self-intersect.</p>

<p>Let Q(m, n) be the number of simple quadrilaterals whose vertices are lattice points with coordinates (x,y) satisfying 0 &le; x &le; m and 0 &le; y &le; n.</p>

<p>For example, Q(2, 2) = 94 as can be seen below:</p>

<p>It can also be verified that Q(3, 7) = 39590, Q(12, 3) = 309000 and Q(123, 45) = 70542215894646.</p>

<p>Find Q(12345, 6789) mod 135707531.</p>
